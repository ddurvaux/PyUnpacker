# PyUnpacker - Python Unpacker

TOOL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Goal: build a python tool / framework to detect packing of binaries.  If binary is packed, use differents tip and tricks to help the analyst with the unpacking process.

Ideally, the tool would try to unpack itself but....

All this is under development.  This code is in the early step and SHOULD NOT be used for the moment.
